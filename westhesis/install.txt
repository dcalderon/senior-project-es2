To use the westhesis document class, download the following two files:

	westhesis.ins
	westhesis.dtx

Run latex directly on westhesis.ins.  This will create two files:
westhesis.cls and westhesis.tex.  The former is the class file; put
it in the same directory as your thesis, or in some directory latex
will look in for input files.  Run pdflatex on the latter file to get
documentation.
