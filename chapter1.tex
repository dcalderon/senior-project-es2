The sure and definite determination (of species of bacteria) requires so much time, so much %
acumen of eye and judgement, so much of perseverance and patience that there is hardly %
anything else so \mbox{difficult}. \par\emph{Otto F. M\"uller}

\section{Description of Problem}
The quote above, by no mistake, graced the cover of the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary %
Microbiology for decades. Whereas plant and animal systematists are guided by a theory based approach %
to \index{demarcating} species, microbiologists have yet to agree on a set of ecological and evolutionary %
properties that could serve to identify bacterial species~\cite{cohan2007systematics}. They are naturally %
handicapped by the paucity of morphological differences that could aide in differentiation of closely related %
bacterial species. Another factor is that microbiologists cannot predict which traits will cause a speciation event since %
bacteria are capable of receiving genes from distant relatives through a process known as horizontal gene %
transfer (HGT)~\cite{cohan2007systematics}. Thus, in order to effectively understand the microbiome we must %
strive towards developing a method for consistently demarcating groups, from bacterial diversity, that play %
distinct ecological roles~\cite{koeppel2008identifying}.

Initially, closely related bacterial species were identified based on metabolic phenotype. Systematists now %
rely on molecular approaches that utilize the decreasing cost of DNA sequencing to compare genetic %
information. A 70\% cutoff was established for whole genome hybridization studies (comparing loss and %
gain of large chunks of DNA), replaced by varying degrees of sequence identities in homologous genes%
~\cite{cohan2007systematics,carlo}. From these technological breakthroughs scientists have taken great steps %
towards understanding bacteria speciation, at the same time they have brought into focus new difficulties.

\subsection{Diversity of Bacterial Species}
Estimates of eukaryotic diversity fall within the range of 10 to 50 million species. Even though we have %
only observed approximately 9000 prokaryotic species, indirect approaches that do not rely on cultivation %
hint at the existence of a billion or more prokaryotic species worldwide and 10 million within a given %
habitat~\cite{cohan2008origins}. The only rational approach to grouping such a large group of diverse %
organisms effectively is with a theory based molecular method.

Current methods for deciding bacterial lineage are not complete. Recent ecological studies %
show that a named bacterial species is typically an assemblage of closely related but ecologically %
distinct populations~\cite{cohan2007systematics}. Our envisioned demarcation algorithm would be capable %
of identifying putative clusters of ecologically distinct organisms within named bacterial clades.

\subsection{Differences of Bacterial Population Dynamics}
As briefly mentioned earlier their exist peculiarities of bacterial population dynamics that complicate %
demarcation.
