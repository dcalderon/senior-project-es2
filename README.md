### Compiling Instructions ###
This was all made using LaTeX in TexShop. I recommend it.

To compile:

1. Open a file called Master.tex.

2. Compile it with LaTeX option selected.

3. Compile with Bibtex selected

4. Finally repeat the LaTeX compilation until all the references
fully appear.


> Note that this will generate all the auxiliary files needed, including a final pdf.

### Usage ###
I am not sure if I need a license for this. For now if you want to use anything you see here simply email me the details and we will go from there.

### TO DO ###
FINISH EVERYTHING!
Also check bug reporter on version control website.

Specific things that should happen in the next few days:

1. Email Danner to get the official LaTeX template used. 
Waiting on a reply.

2. Finish up the first Introduction chapter.

3. Tinker with the outline by adding a section on comparing ES to ES2.

4. Start more chapters!
