\chapter{Improvements of Ecotype Simulation}
\section{Ecotype Simulation 2.0}
\subsection*{Key algorithmic changes}
Describe the ultra-metric changes in detail here.

ES1 binning data, simulation uses rates to actually generate history. Once have history you start with aa...aa sequence and then you evolve mutations until everyone get's a sequence. Then bin those sequences and compare. Count successes.


ES2 Do the backwards thing exactly the same. Except for now we don't have to do binning. Set up as a ultra metric tree
