The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double-backwards-somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the `Star Spangled Banner', but in fact the message was this: \mbox{\emph{So long and thanks for all the fish}}. \par--\emph{Douglas Adams}

\section{Final remarks on ES}

%Re-iterate motivation and purpose of bacterial demarcations
Demarcating bacterial species is difficult.
However the path to understanding microbial speciation has many questions and benefits that attract the cleverest minds.
Do we realize how much microscopic diversity there is out there?
How can we use knowledge of microbial ecosystems to our benefit?
So far people have found applications in a variety of fields: epidemiology, biotechnology, bioremediation, and much more.
Ecotypes Simulation is a a step in the tradition of attempting to understand microbial ecosystem dynamics.

%Talk a little bit about the background and ES
It's based on ecotypes defined as a phylogenetic group of close relatives that are ecologically interchangeable, in that the members of an ecotype share genetic adaptations to a particular set of habitats, resources, and conditions; also, ecotypes are ecologically distinct from one another.
They are the fundamental unit of micro environments that we want to identify so we can understand relationships between groups of atomic units.

...and that is why ES is the best.

However, we should use a combination of approaches, each lending strengths to the other's weaknesses, adding robustness to microbial ecosystem analysis~\cite{bohannan2003new}

\section{For the future}
%Might not need this section, then again some repetition might be good?
Continue to work on ES.
Specific issues with a short description, speed, binning, space usage, demarcation.
Perhaps include small blurb of future wet lab plans?
